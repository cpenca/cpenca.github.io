  <h1>Loved Poems</h1>
  <p>These are some poems that have left a lasting impression on me, have impacted my life, or have influenced my language and the words I use to experience life.</p>
  <p>Links to external sites are impermanent. As such I've tried to use a photo of the poem from a book or a screen shot from a website.</p>
  
  <div class="poet">
    <div class="poet-name">John Berryman</div>
    <p>John Berryman was the first poet I truly studied. He was considered one of the confessional poets. "I didn't want to be like Yeats; I wanted to be Yeats" </p>
    
    <div class="poem">
       <a href="https://cpenca.github.io/Berryman_dreamsong1.png">Dream Song 1h</a>
      <span class="description">— The first poem in what became an expand series of poems. Introduces Henry, a stand-in for the poet, as well as the sense of loss the permeates the work.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44064/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314">Hope is the thing with feathers</a>
      <span class="description">— An uplifting metaphor for resilience and optimism.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poet">
    <div class="poet-name">James Tate</div>
    <p>James Tate turned me on to the idea that poetry can be funny,surreal,and also moving. I came across him early in highschool and probably owe much of my interest in poetry to him.</p>
    
    <div class="poem">
         <a href="https://cpenca.github.io/Tate_thelostpilot.png">The Lost Pilot</a>
      <span class="description">- James Tate's father was killed in a bombing mission during WWII. Tate was very young when he died. I think of the final lines often when the world serves me misfortune </span>
